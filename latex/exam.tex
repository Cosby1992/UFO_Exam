\begin{abstract}
    Java's PriorityQueue class have a bottleneck when you need to update values in the queue.
    Depending on the use and implementation, Java's PriorityQueue can add serious performance 
    issues when accessing the data using the poll() method.
    When updating a value in the queue, performance can be improved by more than 50\% compared 
    to Java's PriorityQueue implementation. Implementing your own version might remove this 
    bottleneck from your software.

\section{Introduction}
Why did we choose this subject
This article will discuss Java's "Build-in" class \lstinline!PriorityQueue!. 
The interest for this topic has grown from an implmentation of a weighted graph 
in Java, which we found had a possible shortcomming for our use-case. The shortcomming was that to update
a value in the queue, we had to use a linear search (loop) through the queue to update 
a value within. That is fine on a small scale, but what if need to draw a graph of all the cities in the world? 
We believe that this has space for optimization and that is why this article explores this subject.


We are going to use a previously developed \lstinline{Timer} class.  


How will we work with the subject

\section{Problem}
\subsection{Background}
% There's no way to find an element in a heap, but to go through all the 
% elements, though pruning (Stop searching if a bigger node is reached) is possible. 
% Therefore a list will be used to make search possible

\section{Analysis}
\subsection{Benchmark Method} % Cosby
This subsection will cover how we prepared and executed our benchmarks.
It will also touch the subject of what we are timing in the two implementations
of a PriorityQueue. We've followed Peter Sestofts approach to microbenchmarking in 
Java \cite{microbenchmarks}, we've used a combination of Mark5 and Mark3 
benchmarks with a few twists here and there. 
To make benchmarks, a Timer class is nessesary. We've designed the simplest
version possible to avoid interference from calculations in the Timer class.


\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Simple Timer class implementation},label={lst:timerclass}]
    public class Timer {
        private long start;

        public void start() {
            start = System.nanoTime();
        }

        public long step() {
            return System.nanoTime() - start;
        }
    }
\end{lstlisting}

This implementation enables us to process the times as nano seconds after 
the benchmarks and also to easily restart the timer.

In addition to the Timer class we have also implemented a TimerTracker class.
This class only consists of two lists that can contain the warmup and real 
benchmark times. Also a method for writing the optained times to a CSV\footnote{Comma Seperated Values Filestructure} file.
The CSV files will be used to explore the data later. 

%How do we measure the times
Measurements in the benchmark is done only on the time it takes to update 
a value in the PriorityQueue. Again we follow Peter Sestofts microbenchmarking 
techniques. In listing \ref{lst:benchmarkiterations} we run a number of warmup iterations before running the
actual benchmark. This is to fight the battle agains Java's JIT\footnote{Just In Time} 
compiler as described in Peter Sestofts article. In the listing the method 
\lstinline{pQueueRun()} is running the benchmark, this will be descriped 
in section \ref{sec:javabenchmark}. The \lstinline{tracker.addTime(long time)} 
simply adds a time to a list that will later be written to a CSV file.
  

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Benchmark iterations}, label={lst:benchmarkiterations}]
    private static void benchmarkPriorityQueue(int warmupIterations, int iterations, TimeTracker tracker) {
        // Printing removed for simplicity
        // Warmup
        for (int i = 0; i < warmupIterations; i++) {
            tracker.addWarmupTime(pQueueRun());
        }

        System.out.println("Warmup finished - moving to real benchmark");

        // Benchmark
        for (int i = 0; i < iterations; i++) {
            tracker.addTime(pQueueRun());
        }
    }
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Benchmark of Java's priorityQueue} % Dima
\label{sec:javabenchmark}
%Describe the method for updating (LINEAR WITH ITERATOR)
To understand the example that we are using we have to take a look at how we use our queue.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Populating the queue},label={lst:Populating_the_queue}]
    PriorityQueue<Node> pQueue = new PriorityQueue<>(QUEUE_LENGTH, nodeComp);

    // Filling the queue with Nodes
    for (int i = 0; i < QUEUE_LENGTH; i++) {
        pQueue.add(new Node(i, i + 1, i));
    }
\end{lstlisting}

We create a simple priorityQueue that takes nodes as an object. Then we add some nodes that fill up the queue, 
the nodes do not have any special values. But we do add a unique values so that we are able to distinguish the nodes.

When were looking at updating a node in Java's priority queue. There is no method to retrieve the wanted node from the list.
Therefore we use a Iterator to list through every node in our list until we find a match.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Finding the node},label={lst:Finding_the_node}]
    Iterator<Node> it = pQueue.iterator();

    while (it.hasNext()) {
        n = it.next();
        if (count == QUEUE_LENGTH - 1) {
            n.verticeTo = 80085;
            time = timer.step();
            break;
        }
        count++;
    }
\end{lstlisting}

Notice that we are listing through the queue in a linear way. 
This is the reason that we are updating the last object in the queue, to simulate a worst case scenario.

% Descripe how we implemented our search 
% Descripe that we are NOT using a heap and maybe that our 
% PriorityQueue is MUCH slower than java, in everything but the update method

% How much faster is the method than Javas
% Boxplots with comparrison

\section{Conclusion} % Cosby
Answer our questions and possibly introduction
% Something about how much faster our queue is at updating
% Something about how our results are to be taken with a grain of salt, 
% since our priority queue inserts elements linear, therefore it's much 
% slower at everything else in Java's PriorityQueue.
