\begin{abstract}
    Java's PriorityQueue class have a bottleneck when you need to update values in the queue.
    Depending on the use and implementation, Java's PriorityQueue can add serious performance 
    issues when accessing the data using the poll() method.
    When updating a value in the queue, performance can be improved by more than 50\% compared 
    to Java's PriorityQueue implementation. Implementing your own version might remove this 
    bottleneck from your software.

\section{Introduction}
Why did we choose this subject
This article will discuss Java's "Build-in" class \lstinline!PriorityQueue!. 
The interest for this topic has grown from an implmentation of a weighted graph 
in Java, which we found had a possible shortcomming for our use-case. The shortcomming was that to update
a value in the queue, we had to use a linear search (loop) through the queue to update 
a value within. That is fine on a small scale, but what if need to draw a graph of all the cities in the world? 
We believe that this has space for optimization and that is why this article explores this subject.


We are going to use a previously developed \lstinline{Timer} class.  


How will we work with the subject


\section{Scope}
What will be in this article
What will not be included in this article

\section{Problem}
The questions we will try to solve 
Problemfomulering

\section{Analysis}
Something about how Java PriorityQueue works now
That it's missing an "update-method". 

How can you make and update method
How much would you gain (compared to linear update on the fly)?

\section{Conclusion}
Answer our questions and possibly introduction
